Linear Combinations 
If $X$ and $Y$ are independent normal variables, then any linear combination $aX + bY + c$ has a normal distribution. We proved this in an earlier section using moment generating functions. We will now show that the same is true if $X$ and $Y$ have any bivariate normal distribution.
