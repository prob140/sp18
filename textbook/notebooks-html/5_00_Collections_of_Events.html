<p>Most questions in data science involve multiple variables and events. Random variables and their joint distributions give us a way to set up probabilistic models for how our data originate. Some techniques are particularly useful for working with large collections of variables and events. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using bounds when exact values are difficult to calculate</li>
<li>Noticing patterns when working with small collections and then generalizing to larger ones</li>
<li>Using symmetry, both for insight and for simplifying calculation</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter we will study powerful examples of all these techniques.</p></div></div></div>
