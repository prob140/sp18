<p>As we saw when we studied Bayes' Rule, conditioning gives us a way of updating our opinions based on new data. Let's see how conditional distributions can be used to represent our opinion about a random parameter, based on data.</p>
<h3 id="Example:-A-Randomly-Picked-Coin">Example: A Randomly Picked Coin<a class="anchor-link" href="#Example:-A-Randomly-Picked-Coin">¶</a></h3><p>Suppose I have one fair coin and three biased coins. Suppose that each of the biased coins lands heads with chance 0.9. I pick one of the coins at random, toss it twice and tell you the number of heads. What can you say about whether the coin was fair or biased?</p>
<p>Before I have told you the number of heads, your <em>prior</em> opinion should be that the chance of the fair coin is 0.25 and the chance that the coin is biased is 0.75.</p>
<p>The goal of this example is to see how the information about the number of heads affects this opinion.</p>
<p>Let $R$ be the probability with which the random coin lands heads. The possible values of $R$ are 0.5 and 0.9, and the prior probability distribution of $R$ is given by the following table.</p></div></div>

<p>Let $H$ be the number of heads in the two tosses. Then the joint distribution of $R$ and $H$ consists of terms of the form</p>

P(R = r, H = h) ~~ \text{where } r \in \{0.5, 0.9\} \text{ and }
h \in \{ 0, 1, 2 \}
$$<p>There are six such terms. Let's work out a couple of them. By the multiplication rule,</p>

<p>Read this table from the bottom row upwards. Remember that the coin was randomly picked.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I tell you nothing about the number of heads, all you can tell me about the coin is that there is 25% chance that it is fair and 75% chance that it is a biased coin.</li>
<li>If I tell you that I got 0 heads, your opinion about the coin changes dramatically in favor of the fair coin. The biased coins have a very small chance of producing no heads, so even though one of them was very likely to have been picked, the data tilt the balance in favor of the fair coin.</li>
<li>If I tell you that I got 1 head, you're in a bit of a quandary. The biased coins have a modest chance (18%) of producing 1 head compared to the 50% chance that the fair coin produces 1 head. But the coin picked had a 75% chance of being biased compared to a 25% chance of being fair. The size of these two effects makes you quite uncertain about which kind of coin to lean towards. You have only a slight lean towards 'biased'.</li>
<li>If I tell you that I got 2 heads, your opinion shifts dramatically towards the biased coins. Not only are they very likely to produce two heads, they are also very likely to have been picked.</li>
